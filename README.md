# Statistical-ML-analysis-on-Titanic-survival-data.

# Objective:
The main objective of this project is to analyze the Titanic survival dataset using statistical methods and machine learning techniques. By examining various factors such as passenger demographics, ticket class, and cabin location, we aim to understand the determinants of survival on the Titanic. Additionally, we'll develop machine learning models to predict passenger survival based on available attributes.

# Dataset:
The dataset used in this project is the Titanic dataset, which contains information about passengers aboard the Titanic, including whether they survived or not, as well as attributes such as age, sex, ticket class, fare, cabin, and port of embarkation.

# Methodology:
* Data Exploration and Preprocessing:

- Load the dataset and perform initial exploratory data analysis (EDA).
- Check for missing values, data types, and summary statistics.
- Visualize the distribution of the target variable (Survived) and explore relationships with other variables using plots and charts.

# Feature Engineering:

* Handle missing data by imputation or removal.
* Create new features or transform existing ones to improve model performance.
* Convert categorical variables into numerical representations.

# Statistical Analysis:

* Conduct statistical tests to analyze relationships between variables and survival rates.
* Explore correlations between different attributes using statistical measures such as correlation coefficients.
* Perform hypothesis testing to determine significant factors influencing survival.

# Machine Learning Modeling:

- Select appropriate machine learning algorithms for Logistic Regression.
- Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
- Train the models using the training data and evaluate their performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Tune hyperparameters to optimize model performance through techniques like grid search or random search.

# Model Interpretation and Evaluation:

- Interpret the model coefficients or feature importances to understand the impact of different variables on survival.
- Evaluate the models' predictive performance using cross-validation or holdout validation.
- Compare the performance of different models and select the best-performing one.

# Conclusion:
By conducting a comprehensive analysis of the Titanic survival dataset, this project aims to provide insights into the factors influencing passenger survival and develop predictive models for future applications. This project serves as a demonstration of data analysis techniques, statistical methods, and machine learning algorithms applied to real-world datasets.
